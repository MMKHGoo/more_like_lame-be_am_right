Zoned and approved housing are often treated as indistinguishable from the supply of housing. But this is not exactly correct.\nZoned capacity is analogous to a natural resource like oil reserves. Oil reserves exist around the globe in various forms, but these oil reserves are not themselves the “supply” of oil.\nInstead the supply of oil is the amount of those reservoirs that are made available to the public by the actions of investors making strategic investments in oil extraction.\nThe rate of oil production and the amount available to us in oil reservoirs then are different—if related—things. The same relationship holds in housing. The rate at which housing is produced (supply) is different than the total amount that could theoretically be produced at a given time (zoning).\nIn the case of housing, the government imposes an artificial limit on the total amount of housing that can be produced through zoning: thus creating an artificial reservoir. But it is developers who determine how much of that available capacity is actually produced.\nThe contention of many housing advocates that the government’s artificial constraints limits housing supply is only true if developers are running up against the limits of zoned capacity. If however, developers are producing housing at a rate far below the limit of housing units available to produce, then it is difficult to conclude that the reason for low levels of production is insufficient zoned capacity1.\n1 Now in reality the artificial limits on housing production by created by zoning are dynamic—the amount of residentially zoned land has steadily increased over Honolulu’s history. Indeed, as we show, the number of units available to developers to produce has remained fairly constant over the last 15 years. Even if the production rate of developers was close to the total limit of available zoned housing, it not true that it’s a hard ceiling so long as new capacity is added to keep the amount available near constant; which appears to be what is happening.We examine this dynamic two ways. First, we look at overall zoned capacity in Honolulu and compare that to production rates, relying for this on the DPP’s Annual Reports, tax map key level datasets provided via Hawaii’s Open Data Portal, and an UIPA request to replicate Table B-1 of the DPP Annual Report to date.\nSecond, we examine the phenomenon in the case of particular projects showing that developers are slow to build even when granted permissions to produce thousands of new units. Such test cases amount to small scale upzoning and consequently provide further caution against assuming such a policy will lead to a bonanza of new homes.\nThe second primary source is the Hawaii Housing Planning Study (HHPS). The HHPS is an addition to the DBEDT prepared Hawaii Housing Demand report. The Hawaii Housing Demand Report looks at changes to population and derives from that changes in household formation and so needed housing.\nThe HHPS attempts to augment the DBEDT report by identifying needed housing beyond that driven by population change and household formation.\n\nOur needed units estimate has three components: (1) a 5-year housing demand estimate based on population change only (18,078), (2) a 5-year target for reducing pent-up demand caused by years of supply shortages (28,459), and (3) a 5-year estimate of the number of units needed to accommodate homeless households (3,619). - 2019 HHPS\n\nIn the 2025 release of the HHPS, the need was estimated at 64.5k units over the next ten years, a 15k unit increase over the 2019 HHPS. The report was also updated to account for housing “in the pipeline”. By this is meant planned production of housing—not the net sum of approved housing. See our discussion of that distinction just above.\nAdditionally the 2025 report’s estimate of needed units includes 28,366 vacant units to facilitate “market function”, representing 43% of the needed units2.\n2 The report uses a standard definition of vacancy rates which as noted is a substantial portion of needed units. However, throughout the report it notes that most of the need is for subsidized low income housing. Similarly, in it’s policy implications section, it promotes substantial governmental involvement in housing development that might be characterized as “social housing”.\n\nThis is significant because if such measures are the supply side solution, the requirements for vacant units will almost certainly be lower. In Singapore for instance, the vacancy rates in HDB housing which covers more than 70% of the population is ~0.2% for much of the last decade. Thus the applied vacancy rate is not fully applicable to the nature of the housing to be provided and possibly overestimated on that basis.\n\nWe also note the report seems to use DBEDT’s 2025-2030 population projections to project demand in the 2023-2027. This is misaligned both in time, essentially moving forward by three years the population projection, and in span, cramming into four years what DBEDT estimates would take five years.The report also highlights that 51,816 units are unavailable to local residents due to their status as “seasonal” housing highlighting the incredible strain that the visitor industry puts on the local housing market."
